					<h1>Physical and Digital</h1>
					<h4>22-12-06 // 10:18 DUBAI</h4>
					<br/>
					
					<p>2002 I was buying CDs with my weekly allowance</p>
<p>2003 I started downloading music. Everything was “free”. But you had to discover. You had to select.</p>
<p>2004 my godfather and we would listen to vinyl records in his music room. The walls were covered with vinyls from floor to ceiling. He’d educate me on genres, artists and general music history. I’d go home and re listen to them.</p>
<p>2005 I started buying my own vinyls.</p>
<p>2006 my godfather an I would not meet in the music room but in the lounge upstairs and we’d sit in front of the computer. We’d listen to the songs he downloaded from iTunes at 99 cents a song and he’d make CDs for me to take home</p>
<p>2007 I had to select a topic for my IB extended essay. I wrote about the ubiquity of music. How streaming would change the way we consume music.</p>
<p>2008 Spotify launched.</p>
<p>2009 I went to university and stopped listening and exploring music as passionately as I had used to</p>
<p>2011 instead of sitting together and listening to music, my godfather started sharing his Spotify playlists with me</p>
<p>2015 I sold my technics 1210 turntables. One of the few pieces of technology hardware that appreciated in price. I had bought them for 300€ eight years earlier and sold them for 500€. They are currently priced around 900€</p>
<p>I still love music but I don’t listen as much as I used to.</p>
<p>Back in the day I used to decide which CDs to pack on a trip.<br>
Later I used to decide which songs to download and load onto my iPod.<br>
Now I have everything. Always, readily available.</p>
<p>Discovery is easier, but I discover less.<br>
It’s easier, but it does not excited me.</p>
<p>My taste changed. It used to be broad.<br>
80s, 90s, Rock, Rap, Techno, Jazz, Soul, HipHop, you name it</p>
<p>Now it’s narrow.<br>
My friends listen to rap. They share rap. I listen to rap.</p>
<p>December 2022. I’m sitting in Dubai.<br>
I’m reading on my Kindle.<br>
A kindle one of my rap-listening-friends gave me for my birthday a month earlier.</p>
<p>It’s convenient. I have 20 books on it.<br>
I’m about to download two books that I have in Germany.<br>
But I want to look things up in right now.</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me<br>
I used to go to record stores the way I go to book stores</p>
<p>Will books go down the same trajectory that music did for me?<br>
Will I read less?<br>
Will I read differently?<br>
Will I lose this too, the way I lost music?</p>
<p>Am I selling myself on the objective benefits but then robbing myself of the reality by not engaging with these new benefits?</p>
<p>2007 I used to plan everything in a moleskin calendar. It worked.</p>
<p>Now my calendar is synced across my five devices : iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook and Apple Watch. I’m not sure im organised any better. Maybe, actually worse.</p>
<p>A digital entry is less of a commitment.</p>
<p>It’s easy to move. </p>
<p>Drag and drop. Clean and easy.</p>
<p>Everyone gets informed.</p>
<p>No crossing out. </p>
<p>No calls to reschedule.</p>
<p>Seamless. Frictionless </p>
<p>Up until 10 years ago I used to be in committed relationships. </p>
<p>Today I can swipe a million faces. Whenever I want, wherever I am.</p>
<p>But I feel less connected. </p>
<p>Again, discovery is easier but I discover less. </p>
<p>I realise this is deeply personal. </p>
<p>The world is changing.</p>
<p>Openai’s chat bot running GTP3 was released a week ago.</p>
<p>Where is the world headed. </p>
<p>How can we make sure that we benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Progress is not only addition but sometimes also subtraction.</p>
