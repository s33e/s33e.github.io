					<p>2002 I was buying CDs with my weekly allowance</p>
<p>2003 I started downloading music. 
	<br>Everything was “free”. But you had to discover. You had to select.</p>
<p>2004 my godfather and we would listen to vinyl records in his music room. 
	<br> The walls were covered with vinyls from floor to ceiling. 
	<br> He’d educate me on genres, artists and general music history. 
	<br> I’d go home and re listen to them.</p>
<p>2005 I started buying my own vinyls.</p>
<p>2006 my godfather an I would not meet in the music room but in the lounge upstairs and we’d sit in front of the computer. 
	<br> We’d listen to the songs he downloaded from iTunes at 99 cents a song and he’d make CDs for me to take home</p>
<p>2007 I had to select a topic for my IB extended essay. 
	<br> I wrote about the ubiquity of music. 
	<br> How streaming would change the way we consume music.</p>
<p>2008 Spotify launched.</p>
<p>2009 I went to university and stopped listening and exploring music as passionately as I had used to</p>
<p>2011 instead of sitting together and listening to music, my godfather started sharing his Spotify playlists with me</p>
<p>2015 I sold my technics 1210 turntables. 
	<br> One of the few pieces of technology hardware that appreciated in price. 
	<br> I had bought them for 300€ eight years earlier and sold them for 500€. 
	<br> They are currently priced around 900€</p>
<p>I still love music but I don’t listen as much as I used to.</p>
<p>Back in the day I used to decide which CDs to pack on a trip.
	<br> Later I used to decide which songs to download and load onto my iPod.
	<br> Now I have everything and anything. Always, readily available.</p>
<p>Discovery is easier, but I discover less.
	<br> It’s easier, but it does not excited me.</p>
<p>My taste changed. It used to be broad.
	<br> 80s, 90s, Rock, Rap, Techno, Jazz, Soul, HipHop, you name it</p>
<p>Now it’s narrow.
	<br> My friends listen to rap. They share rap with me. I listen to rap.</p>
<p>December 2022. I’m sitting in Dubai. 
	<br> I’m reading on my Kindle.
	<br> A kindle one of my rap-listening-friends gave me for my birthday a month earlier.</p>
<p>It’s convenient. I have 20 books on it.
	<br> I’m about to download two books that I have in Germany.
	<br> But I want to look things up in right now.</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me
	<br> I used to go to record stores the way I go to book stores</p>
<p>Will books go down the same trajectory that music did for me?
	<br> Will I read less?
	<br> Will I read differently?
	<br> Will I lose this too, the way I lost music?</p>
<p>Am I selling myself on the objective benefits but then robbing myself of the reality by not engaging with these new benefits?</p>
<p>2007 I used to plan everything in a moleskin calendar. 
	<br>It worked.</p>
<p>Now my calendar is synced across my five devices : iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook and Apple Watch.
	<br> I’m not sure im organised any better.
	<br>Actually, I think it got worse.</p>
<p>A digital entry (for me) is less of a commitment.
	<br> It’s easy to move. 
	<br> Drag and drop. 
	<br> Clean, as if nothing happened.
	<br> As if it had always been where it was just recently moved.
	<br> Not a trace.
<p>Everyone gets informed.
	<br> No crossing out.
	<br> No calls needed to reschedule.</p>
<p>Seamless. Frictionless </p>
<p>Up until 10 years ago I used to be in committed relationships.
<br> Today I can swipe a million faces. 
	<br> Whenever I want, wherever I am.</p>
<p>But I feel less connected. </p>
<p>Again, discovery is easier 
	<br> but I discover less. </p>
<p>I realise this is deeply personal.
	<br> The world is changing.</p>
<p>Openai’s chat bot running GTP3 was released a week ago.
	<br> Where is the world headed?
	<br> How can we make sure that we benefit greatly?</p>
<p>Progress is not only addition <br> sometimes it's subtraction.</p>
