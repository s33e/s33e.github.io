          <h2>5 Tipps how to act in social settings</h2>
          <p>
            <b>(1) Move slow and don't rush when speaking - give a care free attitude </b>
            <br>
- Determine mood I want for interaction (playful, flirty, funny) 
            <br>
- spend first 20 to 30 seconds setting that 
            </p>
            <p>
          <b>(2) Greet everyone around you</b>
            <br>
- Many make the mistake of only greeting the main person (that makes it seem like you want something from them)<br>
- For a deeper connection, combine this with a touch, hug or handshake
              </p>
          <p>
            <b> (3) Be comfortable in every environment and exude that comfort and relaxated mood</b>
            <br>
- Take more space than usual <br>
- Open your body language <br>
- Physical comfort translates to mental comfort putting you at ease
            </p>
          <p>
            <b> (4) Stay anchored to yourself</b> 
            <br>
- Don't do what others are doing<br>
- Stay true to yourself, even if everyone else is different<br>
- Choose who you want to be and be that (don't change to blend in with others around you)
            </p>
              <p>
                <b> (5) Be a magnetic story teller</b>
                <br>
- Use anything, the key is a good pre frame <br>
                - Hook them i.e. <i>So here's a good story...</i> <br>
- Take them on an emotional journey, share your emotional journey <br>
- Act out the characters<br>
- Use speaking cadence and posture <br>
- Tell the story with your hands<br>
- Tell the story in the present tense</p>
