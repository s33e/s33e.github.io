(7) Just do it. Don’t wait, just go for it <br>

(26) Plan regular time with your family and your friends<br>
(27) Keep your eyes on the prize. Always know what the prize is. And make sure it’s still something you want<br>
(28) Everything, especially relationships, start within you and are then carried outside of you and manifested from there<br>
(29) I am abundant beyond belief and I have everything I need within me. The time is ripe, the time is now.<br>
